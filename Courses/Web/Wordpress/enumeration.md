# WordPress enumeration

## WordPress Core Version enumeration

### WordPress version (Source code)

To get WordPress version we had to 

1. `[CTRL + U]` to view source code.
2. `[CTRL + F]` to search for **meta generator**

or use cURL with grep.

```bash
curl -s -X GET <URL> | grep '<meta name="generator"' 
```

```
<meta name="generator" content="WordPress 5.3.3" />
```


### WordPress version (CSS)

CSS can provide also information about version.

```
...SNIP...
<link rel='stylesheet' id='bootstrap-css'  href='http://blog.inlanefreight.com/wp-content/themes/ben_theme/css/bootstrap.css?ver=5.3.3' type='text/css' media='all' />
<link rel='stylesheet' id='transportex-style-css'  href='http://blog.inlanefreight.com/wp-content/themes/ben_theme/style.css?ver=5.3.3' type='text/css' media='all' />
<link rel='stylesheet' id='transportex_color-css'  href='http://blog.inlanefreight.com/wp-content/themes/ben_theme/css/colors/default.css?ver=5.3.3' type='text/css' media='all' />
<link rel='stylesheet' id='smartmenus-css'  href='http://blog.inlanefreight.com/wp-content/themes/ben_theme/css/jquery.smartmenus.bootstrap.css?ver=5.3.3' type='text/css' media='all' />
...SNIP...
```

### WordPress version (JS)

JS can also provide information about version.

```
...SNIP...
<script type='text/javascript' src='http://blog.inlanefreight.com/wp-includes/js/jquery/jquery.js?ver=1.12.4-wp'></script>
<script type='text/javascript' src='http://blog.inlanefreight.com/wp-includes/js/jquery/jquery-migrate.min.js?ver=1.4.1'></script>
<script type='text/javascript' src='http://blog.inlanefreight.com/wp-content/plugins/mail-masta/lib/subscriber.js?ver=5.3.3'></script>
<script type='text/javascript' src='http://blog.inlanefreight.com/wp-content/plugins/mail-masta/lib/jquery.validationEngine-en.js?ver=5.3.3'></script>
<script type='text/javascript' src='http://blog.inlanefreight.com/wp-content/plugins/mail-masta/lib/jquery.validationEngine.js?ver=5.3.3'></script>
...SNIP...
```

### WordPress version (Older version)

In older WordPress versions, another source for uncovering version information is the `readme.html` file in WordPress's root directory.


## Plugin and Themes enumeration

### Plugins Passive Enumeration

```
curl -s -X GET <URL> | sed 's/href=/\n/g' | sed 's/src=/\n/g' | grep 'wp-content/plugins/*' | cut -d"'" -f2
```

```
http://blog.inlanefreight.com/wp-content/plugins/wp-google-places-review-slider/public/css/wprev-public_combine.css?ver=6.1
http://blog.inlanefreight.com/wp-content/plugins/mail-masta/lib/subscriber.js?ver=5.3.3
http://blog.inlanefreight.com/wp-content/plugins/mail-masta/lib/jquery.validationEngine-en.js?ver=5.3.3
http://blog.inlanefreight.com/wp-content/plugins/mail-masta/lib/jquery.validationEngine.js?ver=5.3.3
http://blog.inlanefreight.com/wp-content/plugins/wp-google-places-review-slider/public/js/wprev-public-com-min.js?ver=6.1
http://blog.inlanefreight.com/wp-content/plugins/mail-masta/lib/css/mm_frontend.css?ver=5.3.3
```

### Plugins Active Enumeration

In this case, we have to send requests to the server actively to enumerate them. We can do this by sending a GET request that points to a directory or file that may exist on the server. If the directory or file does exist, we will either gain access to the directory or file or will receive a redirect response from the webserver, indicating that the content does exist. However, we do not have direct access to it.

```bash
curl -I -X GET <URL + URL TO PLUGIN> 
```

```bash
curl -I -X GET http://blog.inlanefreight.com/wp-content/plugins/mail-masta
```

```
HTTP/1.1 301 Moved Permanently
Date: Wed, 13 May 2020 20:08:23 GMT
Server: Apache/2.4.29 (Ubuntu)
Location: http://blog.inlanefreight.com/wp-content/plugins/mail-masta/
Content-Length: 356
Content-Type: text/html; charset=iso-8859-1
```

If the content does not exist, we will receive a `404 Not Found error`.

```
